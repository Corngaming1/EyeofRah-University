# System Requirements

## Functional Requirements
1. **Course Management**: Add, edit, delete, and view courses.
2. **Student Management**: Enroll students, update student details.
3. **Faculty Management**: Assign instructors to courses.
4. **Grade Management**: Record and calculate student grades.
5. **Authentication System**: User login and role-based access control.
6. **Reporting System**: Generate reports (grades, student lists, etc.).

## Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Scalability**: System should handle increasing number of courses and users.
2. **Security**: User authentication and access control.
3. **Usability**: User-friendly interface for administrators and students.
4. **Maintainability**: Code should be modular and well-documented.

# Architecture Design

## Overview
- The system follows a **modular structure**, separating backend logic, frontend UI (if applicable), and documentation.
- **No SQL databases are used**, relying on **file-based storage** for data persistence.

## Components
1. **Backend** (Python-based)
   - Handles course, student, and faculty operations.
2. **Frontend** (If applicable)
   - Provides user interface for managing the system.
3. **Storage Layer**
   - Uses JSON or other file-based storage instead of SQL.
4. **Authentication**
   - Implements role-based access for administrators and users.

# Development Guidelines

## Coding Standards
- Follow **PEP 8** for Python code.
- Use meaningful function and variable names.
- Keep functions small and focused on a single task.

## Directory Structure
```
|___src
|   |___backend
|   |___frontend
|___docs
|___tests
```

## Commit Message Guidelines
- Use descriptive commit messages:
  ```
  feat: Added course creation feature
  fix: Resolved issue with student enrollment
  ```

## Branching Strategy
- `main`: Stable production-ready code.
- `develop`: Active development branch.
- `feature/*`: Individual features (e.g., `feature/course-management`).

# Version Control

## Workflow
1. **Create a feature branch**
   ```sh
   git checkout -b feature/course-management
   ```
2. **Commit changes**
   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: Implemented course CRUD operations"
   ```
3. **Push to GitHub**
   ```sh
   git push origin feature/course-management
   ```
4. **Merge to develop/main when ready**
   ```sh
   git checkout develop
   git merge feature/course-management
   ```
